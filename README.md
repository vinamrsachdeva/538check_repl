# 538check_repl

Attempt at replicating [FiveThirtyEight's calibration and skill scores](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/checking-our-work/presidential-elections/). It's a "work in progress". Till now, I've not been able to replicate the Presidential elections calibration and skill scores yet. I'm trying to understand why.
